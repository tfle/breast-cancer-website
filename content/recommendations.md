One recommendation for policy makers is to subsidise mammograms for women aged 50-69 years of age. Additionally, since many women will discover a breast cancer symptom themselves, policy makers should encourage breast cancer awareness by promoting the knowledge, skills and confidence to detect breast changes and present promptly to a healthcare professional.

Evidently, the greatest incidence of breast cancer was found in individuals aged 50-60 years, postmenopausal women and those of white ethnicity. Additionally, older people are found to have less recurrence events than younger people.
