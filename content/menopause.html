<p>The bar plot shows the number of women who were diagnosed with breast cancer within 1 year and whether they were premenopausal or postmenopausal. As 70% of all breast cancer types are oestrogen receptor positive cancers, starting menopause further increases a woman’s risk of developing breast cancer as the more menstrual periods a woman has, the longer their body is exposed to high levels of oestrogen.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
