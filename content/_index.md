---

Breast cancer is a commonly diagnosed neoplastic disease in women in both economically developed and developing countries. It is the second most common form of cancer behind lung cancer with more than 1.3 million women per year being diagnosed with breast cancer worldwide. Its prevalence and awareness-raising efforts has caused a significant amount of breast cancer research to be conducted to date and data has been collected on breast cancer biology, pathogenesis, risk factors and interventions. This report uses breast cancer datasets from the Institute of Oncology University Medical Centres at Yugoslavia and India, and two other public datasets.
